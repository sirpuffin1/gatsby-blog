*Okay so.* I kinda sorta did want to do a post at least once a day but I already failed. But that's okay! We move forward. Plus, come on. It's the holidays. Or at least it *was*. 


What's there to talk about? I was able to create a LinkedIn post for my recently completed E-commerce site. That felt good. Aside from that, I have finally decided to go all in on a project I have been thinking about for a while now.

**The idea:**
Create a social media app designed for sharing dreams with others. What will make this site unique is that users will be encouraged to document their dreams with their voice as soon as they wake up. They can then add category tags to their post, have their followers interact with their post, and pin their post. I really like the idea of pinning a specific dream that a user might want to dedicate their time to achieving. I plan on using their voice memos and running it through a voice to text api (probably Google's it's really good). That way a user will always have an option to listen to a dream post, or read a transcription of it. 

There are a lot of other smaller details, but that's the gist of it. I plan on making this with Next.Js, and using FaunaDB as my database. We start tomorrow. 

How exciting!
