I so badly want to start with `Hello world!`, but I'm not going to do that. I'm not much of a writer and I definitely don't plan to start being one now, **BUT** I did want to create this blog to document my journey navigating this crazy and unpredictable tech world. After taking some time to really build on the skills I developed over the last year or so, I feel extremely confident and ready to get back on/eat the horse.

Just to make this quick, in this blog I will be discussing:
 - New and interesting tools that I find
 - Project ideas (no matter how terrible they are)
 - Exciting jobs that I apply to
 - and my deepest darkest thoughts

Stick around if you'd like. I think one of my resolutions will be to thoroughly maintain this. Who knows.
We'll see.
Cheers.
