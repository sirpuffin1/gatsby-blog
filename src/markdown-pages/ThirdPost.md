lol. Okay so. *This* is the officially late third post. In my defense, I was kind of embarassed about how little progress I *actually* made. 

## Updates:

 - **I started!**
 - **I learned the importance of planning**
 - **I learned not to rush into something like T3 app (lol)**
 - **I learned about how cool Next Auth is**

This is the current state of the project, and I'm so so happy with how it's turning out. I mostly have Next Auth configured to do everything I need it to. Oh. For anyone that doesn't know Next Auth is an authentication service that is basically going to check to make sure people signing in to the site are legit. It handles a lot of the logic, distributes tokens, has a ton of providers to work with (Google, GitHub, etc.), and adapters to connect to your favorite database. Right now, a user is able to sign in through GitHub and tomorrow I'll be working on allowing the same through user credentials (email, password). 

I had been struggling really hard with the design of the app, ***BUT*** I am really liking the purple wave background thing I have going on for the auth page and will just build around that. 

That's it.
Thanks.
